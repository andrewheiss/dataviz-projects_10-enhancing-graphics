K–12 Education Spending Stagnated or Declined in the South After 2008

Amount of public education funding spent per child in four large Southern states

Per capita education spending (2016 dollars)

Source: US Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances, with other federal and noncensus sources (compiled by the Urban Institute as the State-by-State Spending on Kids Dataset), datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/state-state-spending-kids-dataset

Notes: All dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation to 2016 dollars. These four states are Southern states with large urban centers and were chosen arbitrarily for this exercise. This figure was made as part of an assignment for the Data Visualization in R course at Georgia State University and is not actually produced by the Urban Institute.
